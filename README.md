# Description
In this module, you will go through .NET ecosystem, its implementations and get an overview of the cross-platform development options via multitargeting. As a result of the module, you will create two projects in .NET Framework and .NET Core and a shared library.

# Task 1:

Create 3 basic applications for the following .NET platforms:

.NET Core – console
.NET Framework – WinForms/WPF
Application requirements:

Input: {username} (for console app – as a command line parameter)

Output: “Hello, {username}” (via form or separate window) 

# Task 2:  

Create a .NET standard library which will handle “hello world” concatenation logic. Add this library for both projects. Change the output to following: “{current_time} Hello, {username}!”

# Task 3 (extra, not scored): 

Create Xamarin or MAUI hello world applications.

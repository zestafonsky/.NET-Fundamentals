# .NET Fundamentals

In this module, you will go through .NET ecosystem, its implementations and get an overview of the cross-platform development options via multitargeting. As a result of the module, you will create two projects in .NET Framework and .NET Core and a shared library.  

### Questions for the self-check:

What does the .NET ecosystem provide?

What are .NET implementations? Which ones are used nowadays?

What is CLR?

Why is .NET 5 a bit of a special version?

Which technologies are supported by the .NET framework?

Does cross-platform development is possible in .NET? What about cross-platform UI?

What does the multitargeting term mean?

### Task 1:

Create 3 basic applications for the following .NET platforms:

* .NET Core – console

* .NET Framework – WinForms/WPF

Application requirements:

* Input: {username} (for console app – as a command line parameter)

* Output: “Hello, {username}” (via form or separate window) 

### Task 2:  

Create a .NET standard library which will handle “hello world” concatenation logic. 

Add this library for both projects. Change the output to following: “{current_time} Hello, {username}!”

### Task 3 (extra, not scored): 

Create Xamarin or MAUI hello world applications.
